I make really cool vases as a hobby. These can take weeks to complete and are always made with the giftee in mine. My Mom (50f) and I have always been into nature together. We hike, we own animals, we eat outside if we can. I guess being into nature sounds weird. We just like being outside.

So I made my mom a Siamese cat 'urn.' It looks like a vase, but the top is the cat's ears. It is super cute and I loved the way it turned out. No one died or anything, it was just the style of the piece.

I had finished it and taken it to my apartment, wrapped it up, and been so excited about it. Well, my boyfriend's mother came over and he didn't get her a Christmas/Birthday present. She loves cats, so he just gave her the piece I made. Which she loved.

My boyfriend does not live with me. He has his own apartment near his school. His mother came over before we went over for dinner to see my new kitten. She was in tears over how nice the present was... and I ruined it.

I told her that the presents must have gotten mixed up, that was made for my mother. She got a bit upset, gave it back, then my boyfriend went out to dinner with her. He said it would be best if I didn't come. I guess she cried the whole way and he didn't have a present for her, so he looked like a bad son.

I have trouble seeing where I am at fault. I understand that the nice thing would have been to remake a gift or let her just have it. However, it was one of my best pieces and I always give my mother art I make. She loves it. She shows it off to everyone. It is something she takes great pride in.

She has one from every Christmas and I never miss a year. She even shows off the crappy lumps i made as a kid.

My boyfriend wants to "talk" tomorrow. I am not sure if he is going to break up with me or if he wants to yell at me for it. I just need to know what people think. Was I a jerk? Boyfriend seems to think I was. I love this guy very much and really love his Mom. She is super sweet and kind and never really gets nice things. I still don't think it is my job to cover for his lack of foresight. Her birthday comes every year on the same day, it's not like it surprised him.

I got her a card and a book, which I thought was nice. She thanked me for them later over text, but she seemed really sad about the cat vase. I guess she was hoping I either made her something or my boyfriend actually got her something she really liked. She loves cats and he has never gotten her anything cat themed. It is always some cooking supplies or an apron. Which means he sucks at presents.

So I am just not sure what to think. Does anyone have an idea what to do in this situation?

tl;dr: My boyfriend tried to give away an art piece I made for my mother. I took it back from his mother and now she is upset, my boyfriend is mad, and I think I am getting broken up with.
